shear_pcl_cov documentation
===========================

Welcome to the documentation for the `shear_pcl_cov <https://github.com/robinupham/shear_pcl_cov>`_ repository, which contains all the code needed to produce the figures in "*Euclid*: Covariance of weak lensing pseudo-Cl estimates. Calculation, comparison to simulations, and dependence on survey geometry".

For the adapted version of CosmoCov used to calculate the non-Gaussian covariance, see `CosmoCov_ClCov <https://github.com/robinupham/CosmoCov_ClCov>`_.
